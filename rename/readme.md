To run this simple rename script you must have a lookup.txt document that includes a unique identifier in the first column and the information you want to replace it with in the second column delimited by tabs and with no spaces present in either column. There should not be any identical information for cells in either column. 

It will rename taxa in a set of fasta files in the folder you run the script in. 

At the moment it replaces the unique identifer but it could probably be made to append the information instead or maybe it would be easy to just include that information in the second column as well.
